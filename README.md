When applying machine learning to real-world data, there are a lot of steps involved in the process -- starting with collecting the data and ending with generating predictions. (We work with the seven steps of machine learning, as defined by Yufeng Guo here.)

It all begins with Step 1: Gather the data. In industry, there are important considerations you need to take into account when building a dataset, such as target leakage. When participating in a Kaggle competition, this step is already completed for you.

In the Intro to Machine Learning and the Intermediate Machine Learning courses, you can learn how to:

* Step 2: Prepare the data - Deal with missing values and categorical data. (Feature engineering is covered in a separate course.)
* Step 4: Train the model - Fit decision trees and random forests to patterns in training data.
* Step 5: Evaluate the model - Use a validation set to assess how well a trained model performs on unseen data.
* Step 6: Tune parameters - Tune parameters to get better performance from XGBoost models.
* Step 7: Get predictions - Generate predictions with a trained model and submit your results to a Kaggle competition.
