When applying machine learning to real-world data, there are a lot of steps involved in the process -- starting with collecting the data and ending with generating predictions. (We work with the seven steps of machine learning, as defined by Yufeng Guo here.)

It all begins with Step 1: Gather the data. In industry, there are important considerations you need to take into account when building a dataset, such as target leakage. When participating in a Kaggle competition, this step is already completed for you.

In the Intro to Machine Learning and the Intermediate Machine Learning courses, you can learn how to:

* Step 2: Prepare the data - Deal with missing values and categorical data. (Feature engineering is covered in a separate course.)
* Step 4: Train the model - Fit decision trees and random forests to patterns in training data.
* Step 5: Evaluate the model - Use a validation set to assess how well a trained model performs on unseen data.
* Step 6: Tune parameters - Tune parameters to get better performance from XGBoost models.
* Step 7: Get predictions - Generate predictions with a trained model and submit your results to a Kaggle competition.

That leaves Step 3: Select a model. There are a lot of different types of models. Which one should you select for your problem? When you're just getting started, the best option is just to try everything and build your own intuition - there aren't any universally accepted rules. There are also many useful Kaggle notebooks (like this one) where you can see how and when other Kagglers used different models.

Mastering the machine learning process involves a lot of time and practice. While you're still learning, you can turn to automated machine learning (AutoML) tools to generate intelligent predictions.
